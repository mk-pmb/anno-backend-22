Dublin Core Metadata
====================


Why prefer Dublin Core over an Extension?
-----------------------------------------

See "Why prefer built-in namespaces over an Extension?"
in [built-in_vocab.md](built-in_vocab.md).

------------------------------------------------------------------

For the general syntax part, see
"Anno-model doesn't mention the namespace used. Where is it specified?"
in [built-in_vocab.md](built-in_vocab.md).

In the "Namespaces" chapter, Dublin Core is imported as `dc` and `dcterms`.
At time of writing, the

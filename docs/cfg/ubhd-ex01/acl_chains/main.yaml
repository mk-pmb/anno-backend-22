  - tendency: '*': deny
    # `tendency` sets tentative decisions for selected privileges,
    # which can be overturned by later rules.
    # `*` is the fallback privilege, used when the required privilege
    # has no explicit decision.
    # This entire rule is redundant, because the built-in default is
    # to deny everything.

About the custom_data directory: |

  This config category is meant for site-specific additional data that
  can be referenced in other configs.

  This file is a placeholder because our config mechanism expects at
  least one config per category. We could implement exceptions to that
  rule, but the added code complexity isn't worth it compared to the
  trivial solution.

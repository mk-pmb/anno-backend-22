    # As explained in `./staging_server.yaml`, we use number prefixes
    # for priority. If this file config is enabeld (symlinked),
    # the debug cookie will be tried before the Apache headers are.
    # Thus, when a cookie by this name and with a non-empty value is
    # found, the cookie will win.

    90_debug_cookie:
        method: 'cookie'
        cookie_name: 'user'
        # Set in your browser console: document.cookie = 'user=arno';
        # For guest access, use special username '-' (U+002D hyphen-minus).

    # The cookie IDP worked conveniently for about a week or so, until one day
    # when cookies set via Firefox's JS console started to become unreliable.
    # They were sent with some requests but not others, and depending on the
    # page being displayed, `document.cookie` silently ignored changes,
    # or would even insist to be just an empty string no matter what.
    # I had the choice to either debug Firefox and/or my addons,
    # or add a more reliable fallback:

    91_debug_file:
        method: 'static_from_file'
        path: 'cfg://identity_providers/_whoami.yaml'
        # Prefix `cfg://` points to the server's config directory.
        #
        # The file should either not exist (to skip this identity provider)
        # or sould contain a dictionary with a single key "userId" and a
        # string value that is the username. See `_whoami.arno.example.yaml`.

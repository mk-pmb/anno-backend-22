            #
            # In cases where you don't have a preference, we suggest using a
            # randomness-based (i.e. v4) UUID packaged as a URL by adding the
            # prefix `urn:uuid:` (RFC 4122).

            # defaults to a false-y value. False-y values for the Agent ID
            # will be replaced with an auto-generated UUID URL.

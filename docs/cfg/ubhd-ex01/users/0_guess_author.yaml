# Ideally, we want anno clients to send an explicit author identity,
# because with the licenses we use, correct attribution is very important.
# Any guessing on our side is thus prone to causing legal trouble, so in
# case of any doubt, the safe option is to abort with error.

# In development however, we had a need to experiment with a client software
# for which we weren't able to implement sending author info yet. In order to
# investigate whether that software is useful enough to warrant more effort
# for adding that ability, we need a stopgap that guesses author identity.
